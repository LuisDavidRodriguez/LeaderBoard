## Getting Started

## Setup
If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

[Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 command to clone the files to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1.git
```
- Once the files are on your machine, open the _Portfolio_ folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
